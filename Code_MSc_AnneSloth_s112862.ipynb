    "The reason for chosing an iPython Notebook for the code was to make it easier for the reader to go through the code stepwise to see how data has been generated. As the code can be read cell by cell, hopefully the walk-through og the code will not seem as complex a task. The work in this Notebook is solely the documentation of the code and descriptions of decisions made regarding the collected data to produce the output. In many places the code could have been optimized for ledgibility this however, has not been a priority.\n",
